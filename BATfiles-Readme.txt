Batch files are Windows command-line scripts. They may not run
correctly through Eclipse; you should open a Command Prompt and
run them directly from the command line.

These scripts may be copied and customized for use in your own
projects. Note that they assume that java and javac are in your
default path. See Compile.bat for customization instructions.
